Create a garage sell site that will help people sell their old garbage. The index page should have a form to add a new item, then show all items for sale. Each item should include a picture URL, name, description, and price. Use a Bootstrap Card to make each item look good. Once an item is created it should be automatically added to the index page. You should be able to edit the item for sale.

<strong>Challenge: </strong>
Add a CSS Grid to this page so you can have multiple items per row.

Bootstrap card can be found here: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/
