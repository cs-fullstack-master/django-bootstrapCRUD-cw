Create a garage sell site that will help people sell their old garbage. The index page should have a form to add a new item, then show all items for sale. Each item should include a picture URL, name, description, and price. Use a Bootstrap Card to make each item look good. once an item is created it should be automatically added to the home page.

<strong>Challenge: </strong>
Add a CSS Grid to this page so you can have multiple items per row.
